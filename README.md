# Steam Profile Information

### _What's this?_
A Wordpress widget that retrieves XML-based data from a non-private Steam profile. Steam Profile Information allows you to retrieve and print a profile's attributes, when it's publicly available. The list of attributes includes:

* Avatar, Steam ID, Real Name, Online State, Member Since, Steam Rating 	
* Hours Played in Last 2 Weeks, Group Name, Group Headline, Group Summary 	
* Played Games(Last 2 games, with images and links towards the game application pages)
* "Add to your friends list" link, "View Games" link	 

### _How does it work?_
Like every other widget. After installing Steam Profile Information, it can be found on the widget page of your wordpress installation.

### _Got it. How do I install it?_
* Upload the zip file to your plugins directory
 + Manual upload: Upload it in your "/wp-content/plugins/ directory and unzip it(or create a folder on your own and put all the files there) 
 + Admin Panel: Plugins --> Add New --> Upload --> Browse --> Choose the zipped file from your local dick
- Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
- Go to "Widgets" and drag and drop the "Steam Profile Information" Widget to a widget area.
- Configure the plugin 
 + Title: Widget's title
 + Profile URL: Link to the steam profile you want to retrieve data from. in the form of "http://steamcommunity.com/id/<ID>"
   where **id** is the profile's ID. For instance, for the user "stefki", "http://steamcommunity.com/id/stefki"
 + Check the options you want ("State Message" prints the game the user is playing, if the "Online State" is "In-Game")
* Save 

### _How about Trading Cards statistics?_
I believe Valve doesn't provide a usable API for Trading Cards, yet.

### _Can I provide feedback?_
